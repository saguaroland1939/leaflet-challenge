# Today's Tectonic Activity
#
### This web map displays global earthquake events recorded over the past 24 hours. The live dataset is maintained by USGS at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. Tectonic plate boundaries are overlaid on the map for context. A tectonic plates geojson layer was obtained from a public GitHub repo, https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates, and originated from http://peterbird.name/oldFTP/PB2002/.  
#
### The map is built with Leaflet and utilizes D3 to read in the data.
#
### I am currently exploring ways to adjust the size of the earthquake event circles as the user zooms in.
#
### To view the map, download the repo and run index.html.
